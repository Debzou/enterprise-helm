# Coder Enterprise Workspace Providers Helm [BETA]

WARNING: This branch may contain updates for a yet unreleased version of Coder.
The current state of the repo may not represent the latest release.

This chart provides all of the things necessary to run a beta workspace provider
on a second cluster. This chart is only needed for the beta. Envproxy will
become a subchart of the main Helm chart in the GA release of this feature.

The Helm package here is only a template for releases: version numbers and
image URIs are injected and bundled into releases uploaded to
[helm.coder.com][helm-repo].

You can pull the official charts with `helm repo add coder https://helm.coder.com`.

## Changes From Main Chart

Almost all values are identical in usage to the main chart, but a lot of values
have been removed as they are unnecessary for an envproxy-only deployment. It
should still be safe to provide unused values anyways.

- `envproxy.accessURL` (required if `ingress.host` is not set)
- `envproxy.clusterAddress` (required)
- `cemanager.accessURL` (required)
- `cemanager.token` (required)

You can find documentation for these values below. Settings such as dev URLs and
SSH access only apply to environments created within this Workspace Provider.

## Contributing

All of the Helm charts for Coder services are contained in the
[`templates`][template-folder] folder.

Template values and documentation are in the [`values.yaml`][values-file] file.
The values table in the README is parsed from that file.

This README file is generated from [`README.md.gotmpl`][readme-template-file].
When adding content to the README make sure to update that file.

When adding a value or updating the README template make sure to document it
and run [`gen-readme.sh`][gen-readme-file]. This will update and format the
values table and additional docs.
